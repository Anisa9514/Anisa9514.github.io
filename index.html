                                I am a graduating biomedical engineering major at the University of Texas at Austin with a passion for web development and
                                currently looking for full-time opportunities in software with an amphasis on web programming.

                            <h2>Biomedical engineering => Web Development ?</h2>
                            <p>
                                My fascination with biology led me to choose biomedical engineering as my major. I quickly learned, however, that while learning
                                the theory was great, I was not a big fan of lab work
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Luckily for me, biomedical engineering covers a lot of disciplines, one of which is software. I quickly developed an interest
                                in programming. I loved the ability to solve a problem needing only a computer and some creative
                                thinking.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I then took a software engineering co-op where I got involved in some projects involving web development, and I was hooked.
                                A lot of what I did focused on front end, which I felt was the perfect combination of design
                                and programming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It was when I started spending most of my free time looking up resources on web development that I realized this is the career
                                path I wanted to go to, and I have not looked back since.
